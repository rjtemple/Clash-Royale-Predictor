# Clash-Royale-Predictor
This project uses 5 million matches from the mobile game Clash Royale in order to create models that help players choose the best possible deck to win a game. In the game, players choose from over 100 cards to create 8-card decks that they use to face off in 1-on-1 matches against each other. For this project, I've created two main models. The first is a deck builder, which takes in user inputted cards and builds a deck around those cards to create the optimal, most powerful deck possible. The second is a 'counter' model, which takes as an input the enemy's deck and generates the optimal counter cards to defeat the inputted deck.
